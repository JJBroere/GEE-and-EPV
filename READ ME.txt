This folder contains all necessary files to replicate the 
simulation study for the master thesis "A simulation study
of the performance of (penalized) GEE applied to longitudinal
data suffering from low EPV" by Joris Broere:

-1: Folder "Datasimulation" contains all the scripts 
used to simulate the datasets for the conditions and
the scripts for the validation of the regression coefficients.
For every condition a seperate script is created.

-2: Folder "Estimation functions and analyses script PGEE" contains all functions 
necessary for analysing the simulated data with PGEE. The used function and the 
scripts are in a different folder. It's nesecary to load the 
simulated data files from step 1 into the workspace before running the script.

-3: Folder "Scripts to analyse the results" contains the the scripts to analyse 
the model performance for GEE, GEE with backward selection and PGEE. 
The scripts need the simulated data files from step 1 and the obtained
PGEE estimates from step 2.

-4: The simulations and crossvalidations can take a long time (days).
So in order to save time the simulated datafiles are in the fourth folder.

-5:The simulations and crossvalidations can take a long time (days).
So in order to save time crossvalidated tuning parameters are in the fifth folder.
